<p> I am a Ph.D student in Dr. Mike Ryan's lab at The University of Texas at Austin and in Dr. Rachel Page's lab at The Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute. </p>

<p> As a behavioral ecologist, my primary focus lies in exploring how animals make foraging decisions. This is reflected in my research projects, which explore the dietary preferences and social behavioral patterns exhibited by diverse bat species in both Texas and Panama. Simultaneously, my passion for science communication  intertwines with my research, as I investigate the positive impacts of bats on their environment and their interactions with humans. These multifaceted interests reflect the culmination of various research positions I have held throughout my academic career. </p>

<p> In 2020, I completed my Bachelor of Science degree in Biology at The University of Scranton, where I worked with Dr. Christopher Howey on a research project that focused on exploring the timber rattlesnake's home range size, movement rates, and hormone levels. Additionally, I held an internship position at The Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in 2018, where I worked alongside Ph.D. students investigating the sickness and foraging behaviors of multiple bat species. Subsequently, I furthered my research experience by serving as a research technician at Pittsburg State University, where I worked with a graduate student to investigate the roosting ecology of endangered bat species in Missouri.  </p>
