<p> Understanding how animals affect each other's foraging success is crucial for comprehending how individual actions contribute to population-level dynamics and how they are shaped by the environment. Long-lived animals require a high degree of flexibility and strong learning abilities to thrive in their environments. Therefore, bats, which are gregarious and found globally, are likely to benefit from social learning as they often encounter variability and unpredictability over their long (40+ year) lifespans. This study investigates the underlying factors that shape social foraging behaviors in a neotropical fruit-eating bat. The Jamaican fruit bat (Artibeus jamaicensis) is a prevalent species found throughout the tropical regions of the New World, extending from Mexico to South America. They primarily feed on figs, which are available throughout the year in an asynchronous and random pattern. The objectives of this research are to gain a deeper understanding of this species' behaviors by addressing three key questions.: Q1: What influences socially informed foraging decisions in A. jamaicensis?  Q2: Does the amount of social information available affect the food choices of A. jamaicensis? Q3: How does the temporal order of acquired social information influence foraging decisions in A. jamaicensis? To address these objectives, I propose to house wild-caught bats in flight cages and manipulate food sources and social situations. This approach will provide an opportunity to gain insight into the evolutionary, cognitive and ecological factors that shape animal behavior.  </p>
