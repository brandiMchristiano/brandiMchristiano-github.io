<p> Post here about Ripeness Study </p>![C pers](https://github.com/brandiMchristiano/brandiMchristiano.github.io/assets/77655170/661f3e73-41d1-4fc5-9384-b3dc151661c0)


<p> As fruits mature, they change in ripeness and nutritional content, and different animals may have distinct preferences for specific ripeness stages based on factors such as taste, texture, and nutritional value. In order to maximize the benefit of a foraging bout, animals should be selective in which fruits they eat. The ability of frugivores to adapt their diets to changing conditions is an essential aspect of their ecology and underscores the importance of understanding the complex relationship between frugivores and their food sources.  </p>

<p> Carollia perspicillata is one of 216 species of New World Phyllostomid bats. These bats have a strong preference for Piper fruits (Piperaceae), which are typically found in the forest understory. Since Piper fruits constitute about 60% of C. perspicillata's diet, this species plays an essential role in seed dispersal of pioneer plants. Moreover, males and females of this species exhibit differences in their diet breadth, likely due to the distinct energetic demands of reproduction. In our study, we investigated whether fruit ripeness is another variable that influences the diets of C. perspicillata. We examined ripeness preference differences between males and females as well as between reproductive and non-reproductive males. </p>

<p>For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the hundreds and perhaps thousands more who will, the experience most certainly changes your perspective. The things that we share in our world are far more valuable than those which divide us.</p>

<p>There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.</p>

<p>Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Reaching for the Stars</h2>

<p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

<p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>

<p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
