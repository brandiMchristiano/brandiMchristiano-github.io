<p> Post here about Ripeness Study </p>![C pers](https://github.com/brandiMchristiano/brandiMchristiano.github.io/assets/77655170/661f3e73-41d1-4fc5-9384-b3dc151661c0)


<p> As fruits mature, they change in ripeness and nutritional content, and different animals may have distinct preferences for specific ripeness stages based on factors such as taste, texture, and nutritional value. In order to maximize the benefit of a foraging bout, animals should be selective in which fruits they eat. The ability of frugivores to adapt their diets to changing conditions is an essential aspect of their ecology and underscores the importance of understanding the complex relationship between frugivores and their food sources.  </p>

<p> Carollia perspicillata is one of 216 species of New World Phyllostomid bats. These bats have a strong preference for Piper fruits (Piperaceae), which are typically found in the forest understory. Since Piper fruits constitute about 60% of C. perspicillata's diet, this species plays an essential role in seed dispersal of pioneer plants. Moreover, males and females of this species exhibit differences in their diet breadth, likely due to the distinct energetic demands of reproduction. In our study, we investigated whether fruit ripeness is another variable that influences the diets of C. perspicillata. We examined ripeness preference differences between males and females as well as between reproductive and non-reproductive males. </p>
